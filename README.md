### What is Pomodoro?

The Pomodoro time management helps the user to resolve multiple tasks by amplifying the focus on each tasks by timing the sessions with intense work and break intervals.

### About My Pomodoro Timer

My Pomodoro Timer keeps the work sessions to be 25-minute and 5-minute breaks in between each sessions and the user gets 30-minute long break on every fourth break of the interval.

The user cannot pause the timer once the timer starts and it has to reset if the user wants to stop the timer.

The user gets an alarm when the time-set ends, and after each sessions the task can be recorded on the task list as an achievement.
